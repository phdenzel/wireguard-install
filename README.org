This is yet another wireguard install script for linux. During the
process of installing wireguard on my own server, I've written down
the individual steps. When I was finished, I was left with a working
(and tested) install script, so there you go...


** Usage

The Makefile is here For ease of use. Simply type

#+begin_src shell
make install
#+end_src

to set up a server and client configuration interactively. For
multiple clients simply repeat the command as many times as you have
clients and choose different client names each time.

For a local install, use
#+begin_src shell
  make dirs
  sudo WG_INSTALL_PREFIX="$(uname -n)/etc" bash wireguard-install
#+end_src

Once you're happy with the local configuration, install it with
#+begin_src shell
  make push
#+end_src
